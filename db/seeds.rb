Author.create(name: "Wills Blake", genre: "Horror", bio: "My name is Wills Blake. I was born in the United States, in Florida. I have lived here most of my life, aside from one small 3 month stint abroad. I really enjoy spending time in the kitchen. When I can find an evening or even whole day to make something fun, it's special. I enjoy baking both savory and sweet concoctions, with respect to that order of course (go team savory). There's nothing like a warm and soft loaf brought to you by your own efforts. I am currently working toward entering the web development realm, and currently enrolled with Flatiron. My experience with the program has been very good so far, seeing as this site is live within only 4 months of the beginning. I will continue to update the contents of this domain in tandem with the program's progression.")
Post.create(title: "Language Is Language, Sorta", description: "Spoken language isâ€¦complicated. The constant influence from culture and geographical location make language a fluid and dynamic method of communication. This dynamic nature of spoken language is the key difference between itself and the language of computers, a synthetic language. Synthetic languages are languages implemented using a language already in existence. For example, Ruby would be an example of a language built using English. You could argue that a synthetic language, such as Ruby, is in fact dynamic. It continuously fluctuates toward the demands of the current programming community, so why would it not be counted as dynamic? Any new feature or addition to a programming language has a discrete purpose. It behaves consistently, given you follow the rules of its implementation. The interpreter is updated with an addition first, then the authors are made aware of the addition. This gives way to a more refined difference between natural and synthetic language. People speak in novel ways, using grammatical mechanisms and a lexicon influenced by their culture and surroundings. With regard to spoken language, it is the responsibility of the interpreter to parse information not yet heard before. Our brains are pretty remarkable in this right. Synthetic language is the other way around, with the author(speaker, in our spoken language example) being updated of the changed to the language after our interpreter is notified. This is not the only difference between the two, but does shed some light into each of their behavior.")
